Files in this directory:

 Python implementation:
   rns.py -- implementation of RNS system in Python
   pytests.py -- test suite for Python implementation

 Assembler implementation:
   rns.h -- header file for RNS implementation
   rns.s -- implementation of RNS system in Assembler
   main.c -- main program doing computations in RNS using Assembler library

Launching the Assembler implementation:
  ./rns 56 78
will compute sum, difference and multiplication of the given values in decimal
system. All computations will be done using Assembler RNS library.

There is also another mode of execution, without conversion to decimal.
When launched as:
  ./rns 1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6
the program will compute sum, difference and multiplication of the given
values, interpreted as [1 2 3 4] and [9 8 7 6], and print the results also
in RNS notation, one in a line.

To run a test suite on a whole project, run:
  ./pytests.py
