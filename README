 Written in Python:
   rns.py ------- implementation of RNS system in Python
   pytests.py --- test suite for Python implementation

 Written in C:

User Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~

Launching the Assembler implementation:
  ./rns 56 78
will compute sum, difference and multiplication of the given values in decimal
system. All computations will be done using Assembler RNS library.

There is also another mode of execution, without conversion to decimal.
When launched as:
  ./rns 1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6
the program will compute sum, difference and multiplication of the given
values, interpreted as [1 2 3 4] and [9 8 7 6], and print the results also
in RNS notation, one in a line.

Computer-readable output is sent to stdout (bare numbers), while human-readable
output is sent to stderr (with additional information). So, to see only
human-readable output, one may use:
  ./rns 1754 5347 2>/dev/null

To run a test suite on a whole project, run:
  ./pytests.py

The test suite tests both the Python RNS library and the native program.


Developer's Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should take a first look at rns.h. There are all the prototypes of
functions implemented in Assembly to perform RNS-based arithmetic.

For the implementation of a particular function, refer to *.s files.
